Fun House Writing â€“ Write bad, do everything wrong, it'll be fun. This folder contains the games and logic for the Funhouse section of the writing game.

## Funhouse prompt sets

The file [`funhouse_prompt_sets.json`](./funhouse_prompt_sets.json) contains deliberately warped prompt variants for key writing lessons. Each entry includes a slugified title, a comedic description of the distortion, the full prompt text, mode metadata, and the lesson source ID. Import [`funhouse_prompt_sets.ts`](./funhouse_prompt_sets.ts) to access a typed array for UI experiments or tooling.
